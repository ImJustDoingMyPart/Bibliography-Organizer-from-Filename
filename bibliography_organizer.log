I will give you a filename of a file which is an academic work. I want you to use the data in the filename to look in the web for the full title of the academic work and its author's surname. Also, find out if it is an article or a book. I want you to return ONLY a JSON object with the title (the key will be named title) and author's surname (the key will be named author) obtained, and also with the document type (article or book, the key will be named document_type). The response must contain ONLY the JSON, no other text. Do not give me responses with code blocks! Use empty strings if you can't determine both values clearly. iek-Negotiating_power_and_authority_in_the_desert_the_Arab_Bedouin_and_the_limits_of_the_Ottoman_state_in_Hijaz_18401908.pdf
